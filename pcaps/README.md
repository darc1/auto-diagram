## Attack Types Documented

### NSCacheFlush Attack
A DNS cache poisoning attack that exploits DNS resolvers by:
1. Sending queries for malicious domains
2. Receiving referral responses with excessive NS records (up to 1500 names)
3. Causing cache pollution and eviction of legitimate records
4. Resulting in cache thrashing and potential service degradation

**Variants:**
- **NS Records Attack (E1)**: Uses excessive NS record responses
- **CNAME Attack (E2)**: Leverages CNAME records for cache manipulation

### NRDelegation Attack
A sophisticated DNS attack targeting delegation mechanisms (documentation only).

## Usage in Auto-Diagram

These pcap files and documentation serve as:
- **Training data** for understanding network attack patterns
- **Context files** for generating accurate network diagrams
- **Reference materials** for validating diagram accuracy
- **Examples** for demonstrating the auto-diagram system capabilities

## File Formats

- **`.pcap`** - Wireshark packet capture files containing network traffic
- **`.pdf`** - Research papers and technical documentation
- **`.md`** - Markdown files with structured attack explanations
- **`.png`** - Visual diagrams and flowcharts
- **`.txt`** - Plain text summaries and notes

## Integration with Auto-Diagram

To use these files with the auto-diagram system:

```bash
# Generate diagram using NSCacheFlush context
python src/cli.py create \
  "Generate a network diagram showing the NSCacheFlush attack flow" \
  --supporting-files pcaps/NSCacheFlush \
  --output output/nscacheflush_diagram.mmd
```

The system analyzes the pcap files, documentation, and visual materials to generate accurate Mermaid diagrams representing the network attack flows.

## Research Context

These materials are part of academic research on DNS security vulnerabilities and are used for:
- Understanding modern DNS attack vectors
- Developing mitigation strategies
- Educational purposes in network security courses
- Automated diagram generation for complex network scenarios
