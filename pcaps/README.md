## Attack Types Documented

### NSCacheFlush Attack
A DNS cache poisoning attack that exploits DNS resolvers by:
1. Sending queries for malicious domains
2. Receiving referral responses with excessive NS records (up to 1500 names)
3. Causing cache pollution and eviction of legitimate records
4. Resulting in cache thrashing and potential service degradation

**Variants:**
- **NS Records Attack (E1)**: Uses excessive NS record responses
- **CNAME Attack (E2)**: Leverages CNAME records for cache manipulation

### NRDelegation Attack
A sophisticated DNS attack targeting delegation mechanisms (documentation only).

## Usage in Auto-Diagram
